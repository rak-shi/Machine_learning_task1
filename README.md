# Machine_learning_task1
This project focuses on Gesture Recognition, Lip Tracking, and Data Augmentation using modern machine learning techniques, primarily utilizing MediaPipe and TensorFlow.
# The objectives of the project are:

To recognize hand gestures (such as the "OK" gesture) from images or video frames.
To track lip movements and extract lip-related features from video frames for further analysis.
To perform data augmentation to expand the dataset, making it more diverse and robust for machine learning models.
